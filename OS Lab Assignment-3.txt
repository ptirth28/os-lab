Write a C program to implement FCFS scheduling algorithm with the following specifications.

 

a) Read from user the inputs arrival time and burst time for N number processes. (Each process must be assigned a unique number.)

b) Compute completion time, response time, turn- around-time, waiting for each process. Also compute ATAT and AWT.

c) Print the Process scheduling table with entries (Pno, AT, BT, CT, TAT, WT)

d) Print the Gantt Chart also.
